# CebuanoDistilBERT
Googleâ€™s language model BERT has be-
come a staple in natural language process-
ing (NLP) tasks and experiments. Utilizing
the same transformer-based pre-trained Distil-
BERT model and architecture, we developed
a single-language DistilBERT model based
on the Cebuano language called C-BERTo.
